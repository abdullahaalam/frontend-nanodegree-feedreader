# Feed Reader Testing
## Project Overview
In this project, I will be learning about testing with Javascript. Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard known as "test-driven development" or TDD. This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application.

Whether I work in an organization that writes tests extensively to inform product development or one that uses tests to encourage iteration, testing has become an essential skill in modern web development!

## Installation and Running the Feed Reader Testing
Clone the GitHub repository and open index.html for Feed Reader Testing Project
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/abdullahaalam/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader.git
```


## Test Coverage:
#### Part 1 (RSS Feeds)
* Write a new first test suite named "RSS Feeds" - a test suite just contains a related set of tests. This suite is all about the RSS feeds definitions, the allFeeds variable in our application.
* RSS Feeds are defined.
* RSS Feeds should have a defined URL.
* RSS Feeds should have a defined name.

#### Part 2 (The menu)
* Write a new second test suite named "The menu".
* The menu should have menu element hidden by default by using class menu-hidden.

##### Part 2.5 (when clicked)
* Write a new test suite named "when clicked".
* When clicked should display the menu.
* When clicked should hide the menu.

#### Part 3 (Initial Entries)
* Write a new test suite named "Initial Entries".
* Initial Entries has added entries.

#### Part 4 (New Feed Selection)
* Write a new test suite named "New Feed Selection".
* New Feed Selection should be new stuff.
